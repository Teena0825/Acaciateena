            <h3>I born in Hyderabad, India. I began experimenting with designing and making
                own clothing. After graduating with a degree in art education, I began an apprenticeship with a
                milliner.
                When I finally opened own boutique in Kings Road in Hitech city, the shop became an immediate success.
                The
                colorful shift dresses with contrasting collars, and plastic trench coats, I created helped popularize a
                style of
                dressing that came to be known as the Mod Look.Hence I have started an academy for fashion designing
